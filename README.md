# multiscale_t_cell_activation

This repository contains Matlab codes for the model of T cell activations via three cell- interactions. Among various internal versions, this is the version
used in the publication "A local regulatory T cell feedback circuit maintains immunological homeostasis by pruning self-activated T cells" (2021, Cell). Detailed mathematical descriptions and biological assumptions are located in the folder 'model descriptions'

## Executing the model

In the folder 'codes', execute the file 'full_model.m'.
