# multiscale_t_cell_activation

This repository contains Matlab codes for the model of T cell activations via three cell- interactions. Among various internal versions, this is the version
used in the publication "A local regulatory T cell feedback circuit maintains immunological homeostasis by pruning self-activated T cells" (to be submitted). For detailed mathematical descriptions and biological assumptions, please refer to the the paper.
